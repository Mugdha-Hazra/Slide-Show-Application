# Slide-Show-Application
A SIMPLE SLIDE SHOW APPLICATION MADE USING PTHON

## IMPORTANT MODULES AND FUNCTIONS USED IN THE PROJECT
**================================================================**

## itertools is a inbuilt module in python 
it has functions to create iterators that enables you to loop through elements (for efficient looping)
we only want cycles from the itertools module.

## **cycle** -->it is an iterator from the itertools module. it returns element from a iterTable e.g a list.
next we will import the tkinter module which is going to help us in building the gui of our application.

SOME IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS
============================

   # __init__() : is a built in function called automatically every time the calss is being used to create a new objects,
    it can also be used to assign values to object properties

   # self : its a variable represents the instance of the object of the object itself .
    it is important to use the self parameter inside an object's method if you want to persists the value with the object.

   # geometry() : Tkinter provides various universals method one of them is geometry() method.
    this method is used to set the dimension of the Tkinter window as well as it is used to set the position
    of the main window on the useers desktop.

   # PhotoImage() : it is a class is used to display images(either grayscale or true colour images) in lables, buttons, canvases and text widgets.
    the PhotoImage class can read GIF and PGM/PPM images from files 

   # pack() : this geometry managers origanise widgets in blocks before placing them in the parent widget.

   # after() : it is a method defines for all tkinter widgets. 
    This method simlpy calls a soecificied function after the given delays in ms. 

   # mainloop() : it is a method is used when you are ready for the application to run.

  #  list() : a List is a collection which is ordered and changable.
